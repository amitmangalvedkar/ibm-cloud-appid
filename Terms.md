This list is purposely **not** kept in alphabetical order as each term needs to be read in this order.  
1. **Identity Provider** - Facebook, Google+, SAML 2.0 Federation, Cloud Directory   

2. **OAuth 2.0** - Open standard protocol that is used to provide app authorization  

3. **Open ID Connect (OIDC)** - an authentication layer that works on top of OAuth 2.0  

4. **JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)** - framework intended to provide a method to securely transfer claims (such as authorization information) between parties.  

5. **JSON Web Token (JWT)** - JSON Object which is either a JWS (JSON Web Signature) or JWE (JSON Web Encryption)  

6. **Access tokens** represent authorization and enable communication with back-end resources that are protected by authorization filters that are set by App ID.  

7. **Identity tokens** represent authentication and contain information about the user. It can give you information about their name, email, gender, and location.  

8. **Refresh Token** is a special kind of token that can be used to obtain a renewed access token —that allows accessing a protected resource— at any time. You can request new access tokens until the refresh token is blacklisted. Refresh tokens must be stored securely by an application because they essentially allow a user to remain authenticated forever.
