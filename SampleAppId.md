## Configuring a sample app

You can use one of the preconfigured sample apps to get familiar with working with the service.

Out of the box, the sample apps are configured with two identity providers (Google and Facebook) and the ability to review authentication. You can also use the login widget feature to customize a sign-in page and see how quickly the updates that you make are shown in your app. _(How do we use other Identity providers such as GitHub or IBM Id)_

To configure a sample app from the GUI, follow the steps in the GUI to Build and run your sample app.

Following languages are supported
1. Node.js (pre-requisite is cf cli)
2. Java (pre-requisite is cf cli and maven)  

Apart from these Android and Swift are also supported.
